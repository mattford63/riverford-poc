# riverford-poc

- See the design brief [here](https://github.com/riverford/recipe-search-tech-test).

- See the PoC development history
[here](https://github.com/mattford63/riverford-poc/commits/master) for
a track of development decisions and optimisations.

## Approach

Given the time constraints to do this the focus has been on a solid
foundation from which to further develop out the search solution.

The essential requirement of speed (<10ms) and simple relevance has been
focused on. Sophisticated search techniques and recipe management are
out of scope for now.

The very first pass used
[clucie](https://github.com/federkasten/clucie) to get a feel for the
problem space (see
[here](https://github.com/mattford63/riverford-poc/blob/b7f7e4901a762d387f80943af4aab2c49d9601b7/src/riverford_poc/core.clj)).
However, after talking with RiverFord a from-scratch approach was
required.

Inverted indexes are excellent for building search engines
over. _"Introduction to Information Retrieval"_ by Manning, Raghavan
and Schutze provides a very good overview of the process and
efficiency algorithms.  The code implements the methods and algorithms
in the book outlined
[here.](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/a-first-take-at-building-an-inverted-index-1.html)

The core abstraction is an `index-store` which contains `indexes`.The
recipes are of a consistent format and have the following sections

- title
- introduction
- ingredients
- method

The code is written such that each section of the recipe is an index
within the index-store.  Allowing searches to be constrained to a
particular section.  ~~Then a merge operation over the four indexes
creates a 5th index `all` - over which the entire recipe can be
searched.~~ Also, each document is stored as it's own index, each with
it's own recipe section and a combined :all index.  There is also a
single global :all index to search everything.  All these indexes
allow relevancy based search at the expense of large increase in
index-store size.

The speed of the search comes from using ordered vectors as the data
structure for the document ids in the reverse index. A class of
merge-algorithms that rely on the fact that vectors are ordered offer
more speed up when performing operations.  The computational expense
of the initial import operation ~50s is the price paid up front for
sub <5ms search later.

A DSL consisting of `intersect`, `union` and a limited `not` provide
search operations over the index-store.

## Usage

To test run `lein test`.  There's quite a lot of test coverage and the
page also highlights the shape of the data structures used.

The PoC is currently managed by the REPL. An example section at the
end of `core.clj` can be used to explore the functionality.  Just
remember to unzip and change the directory location appropriately.

## Issues

- The `not` implementation is naive and very restricted at present to
  where it can be used.  The fix is to maintain in each index a full
  list of the document ids used in that index.
- The storage format is very in-efficient now that each document is added
  as in index in the store.  The memory consumption of the index-store
  is around x15 of the size of the on-disk space.


## Future work

- Use a more compact form of index for individual documents.
- Migrate away from PoC code e.g. namespace fuctions appropriately,
  split tests etc.
- It should be relatively quick to add one of the these clojure
  [fuzzy stemmer](https://yomguithereal.github.io/clj-fuzzy/clojure.html) algorithms to
  [here](https://github.com/mattford63/riverford-poc/blob/master/src/riverford_poc/core.clj#L76)
  and
  [here](https://github.com/mattford63/riverford-poc/blob/master/src/riverford_poc/core.clj#L174).
  This would be a good way to make the search seem way more sophisticated.
- ~~At present the individual document frequencies are lost when
  combined. A more sophisticated reverse index data structure would
  allow this data to be kept - this would open up the door to
  relevancy scoring based on term frequency.~~ DONE
- The tokenizer used records word position, by extending the reverse
  index data structure even further we could capture this also.
- Think about whether the index-store should be atomic.
- ~~Think about a mechanism of updating the all index on other index updates.~~ DONE
- Parallelise the input (possibly transducers) but is it worth it?
